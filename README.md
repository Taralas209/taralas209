## Alexej Zikunow

Hello! I'm Alexej, a seasoned Digital Marketing and project management professional transitioning into software development. Since August 2022, I've been deeply immersing myself in Python and have worked on multiple projects to enhance my skills and gather hands-on experience.

I specialize in Python, covering key areas such as data analysis, web development, automation, and testing. I also have a keen interest in artificial intelligence, especially Large Language Models (LLM). My other skills include working with JIRA, Git, Flask, Django, and REST-API.

My past experience involves leading teams, strategic planning and implementation of Digital Marketing projects, and ensuring the smooth operation of IT infrastructure and internal processes. I believe my problem-solving, process implementation, and team management skills will be an asset in my new role as a developer.

I'm looking for opportunities to leverage my newfound skills in a software developer role, where I can utilize my passion for problem-solving and technology to create effective software solutions.

Please check out my repositories below to see my recent projects. If you have any questions or proposals, feel free to reach out.
